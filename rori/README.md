# rori_www

This is a website created to present what is _[RORI](https://github.com/AmarOk1412/rori/)_ and to configure an instance.

# Configure

In _downloads.json_ you can configure the index page. You just have to add entries like this:

```json
{
  "img":"images/rori_server.png",
  "name":"Core Server",
  "description":"This is the central point of RORI. This application get data from entry points, call modules to process this data and send data to endpoints to execute commands.",
  "url":"https://github.com/AmarOk1412/rori_server"
}
```

In _configure_part.json_ you can configure which is the path to configurate `rori_server` and which modules groups you want to configure. For example:

```json
{
  "General":"config_server.json",
  "Modules:text":"text.json",
  "Modules:temp":"temp.json"
}
```

This configuration will show the third screenshot.

# TODO

- A video to present what is RORI
- A list of all available entry, endpoints and modules.
- [sshweb](https://vtllf.org/sshweb.html) (I think it's fun)
- Configure an instance
