      <description>In the first article of this series, we saw how to make an application (DEL) which is able to transfer a file from one peer to one another by successfully bypassing the NAT thanks to a TURN server. However, this technique is not really effective, because, in a lot of cases, a TURN server is completely useless. Indeed, if both peers are on the same network or both peers has an IPv6 address, the TURN server is not mandatory.</description>

      <description>I love distributed systems for a various of reasons. But these systems are complex and require interactions with many layers. Even if a lot of distributed systems and software exists, such systems can be difficult to use for several reasons. Today, our operating systems tend to avoid doing as many calculations as possible (i.e. mobile devices need to save battery and avoid data consumption). Also, IPv4 is still massively used so NATs are still needed, interfaces are mainly created to interact with servers, etc.</description>
